HOW TO USE
well for those few that may have no idea on how to run a shell script,  
you need to install ruby1.9.x  apt-get install ruby1.9 
then chmod 700 eriot.rb 
and to run do: ruby eriot.rb or ./eriot.rb
to stop for now just ctrl+c 

-eRiot_r-u-dead-yet-
HOW TO USE
This version of eRiot uses a web form attack called r-u-dead-yet
there is a working and more mature python script called rudy
also a document called OWASP-Universal-HTTP-DoS
this script is very far from finish if you are serious about testing 
consider using rudy instead.
well for those few that may have no idea on how to run a shell script,  
you need to install ruby1.9.x  apt-get install ruby1.9 
you need also to install flags a ruby library
sudo gem install flags
then chmod 700 eriot_r-u-dead-yet.rb 
and to run do: ruby eriot.rb or ./eriot.rb with parameter -target targerhost.org/form/path  
remember you have to point it to a form and again this script is far from finish.
to stop for now just ctrl+c
